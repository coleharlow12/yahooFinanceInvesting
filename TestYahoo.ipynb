    "- [Total Liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/total-liabilities.asp) : Total liabilities are the combined debts and obligations that an individual or company owes to outside parties. Everything the company owns is classified as an asset and all amounts the company owes for future obligations are recorded as liabilities.

    "- [Current Liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp) :This one is more complex as the call to balance sheet odes not include it as a column.
