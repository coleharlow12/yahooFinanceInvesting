Includes cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, stock inventory, marketable securities, pre-paid liabilities, and other liquid assets (Available via call to Balance Sheets as 'currentAssets')\n",
    "- [Total Liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/total-liabilities.asp) : Total liabilities are the combined debts and obligations that an individual or company owes to outside parties. Everything the company owns is classified as an asset and all amounts the company owes for future obligations are recorded as liabilities. (Available via call to Balance Sheets as 'totalLiabilities')\n",
    "- [Current Liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp) :This one is more complex as the call to balance sheet odes not include it as a column.
